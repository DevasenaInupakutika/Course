http://jrmeyer.github.io/tutorial/2016/02/01/TensorFlow-Tutorial.html  
  
Follow the steps in the tutorial and train the model.  
  
Part I:  
1. What's the best accuracy you get on the test dataset?  
2. What's the optimum value of the numEpochs and the learningRate.  
3. Vizualize the model with Matplotlib and TensorBoard  
  
Part II:  
-  Change the model to 3 layers neural network and compare the results
